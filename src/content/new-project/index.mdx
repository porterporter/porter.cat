[work in progress]

Hi everybody! In an attempt to at least be semi-regular with posting, I thought I would share a little bit about a new project I'm working on for a client.

*the home page*

The project (eventually) will be used as a scheduling service for a restaurant. At the moment there are three sections, two for regular employees, and one for administrators/schedulers.

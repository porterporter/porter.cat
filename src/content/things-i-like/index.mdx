hello loyal porter.cat readers\
here's another brain dump about things i'm interested in going into 2026.

### things i want:
* physical alarm clock with nice wake up noises. loftie?
* ~new work shoes~ i'm now the proud owner of a pair of dansko professionals. review coming soon?
* carbon steel pan. no more non-stick in 2026

### things i want to do:
* road trip somewhere
* write a backend in zig
* read more books (this is a cop out but whatever)
* write more blog posts. maybe 5?

I spent the beginning of my spring break in Chicago and had the opportunity to try out a few specialty coffee shops on my trip. Here's the good, the bad, and the really bad.

## Sawada Coffee (West Loop)
The first place we checked out was [Sawada Coffee](https://www.instagram.com/sawadacoffee/). The aesthetic in here was on point. I thought the branding was on point and the shared space with the Texas-style BBQ place was really sick.

But that's really where all the good things about this place end...

Here's my oat cortado with their **Project X Espresso**. Latte art was impressive, but the milk texture was too heavy. Espresso was wildly dark, like charred. Honestly some of the worst espresso I've had from such a nice setup.
